## Chapter 1: New Beginnings

My journey into the world of software engineering began during middle school, a time when my career aspirations were still undefined. At the time, I was convinced that a future in healthcare was my calling—a path that couldn't be more different from the one I ultimately chose: computer science. However, it only took one elective class to completely change my direction.

When registering for courses for that semester, I still had an unfulfilled elective requirement I needed to satisfy. One of the courses that caught my eye was called “Introduction to Python Programming.” At the time, I pursued hobbies such as learning video editing software and 3D modeling with Blender and Cinema 4D, but programming felt like uncharted territory. As the course went on, I was blown away by how quickly I got the hang of programming and how much fun I was having. Projects like recreating classic games such as Pong, Spot the Difference, and Cards weren’t just homework; they were chances to bring my ideas to life. Watching my code transform into something real and interactive felt like magic to my twelve-year-old brain. I couldn’t wait to show off my creations to friends and family, soaking up their praise, even if they were just being nice. To me, these projects were more than just coding exercises—they were my ticket to a world full of endless possibilities.

## Chapter 2: Finding my Niche
Now, as an undergraduate majoring in computer science, I’ve had the chance to explore the many different fields that computer science and offers, such as software engineering. While I admire the rigor of data sciences and mathematics, I’ve found my passion lies more on the creative side of computer science. The front-end aspects of software engineering, such as UX/UI design and web development, resonate with me the most. These fields allow me to merge my technical skills with my creative instincts, crafting interfaces that are not only functional, but aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

I’m also fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence, especially in how it can enhance educational tools and professional environments. The intersection of AI and UX/UI design is particularly exciting because it offers opportunities to create intuitive and adaptive systems that truly meet users’ needs. My coursework, especially in ICS 314, has already begun to expose me to these concepts, and I am looking forward to delving deeper into modules such as UI and applicaiton design, which align perfectly with my interests. I believe that understanding how humans interact with computers is not only fascinating, but also crucial in shaping technology that truly serves us.

## Chapter 3: Charting the Future
Looking ahead, I’m committed to sharpening my skills by taking on personal projects that push my creativity and technical abilities to new heights. I’m also planning to pursue a variety of internships that align with my interests in UX/UI design, web development, and AI. These experiences will not only help me build my technical expertise but also give me a broader understanding of what these fields really entail.

In terms of what I am working on now to develop my skills, I am in the process of conducting a research project titled “Exploring the Impact of Digital Design on Problem-Based Learning”, funded by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program. This project aims to explore how digital design influences student learning, addressing a critical gap in our understanding of technology-enhanced educational environments. By investigating the relationship between design choices and cognitive processes, especially in problem-solving, my research has the potential to inform the development of more accessible and user-friendly digital tools. The insights gained from this work extend beyond the realms of human-computer interaction and computer science, offering valuable applications across various domains where technology and user experience converge. Overall, I firmly believe that pursuing a career in UX/UI design will empower me to address real-world challenges, making technology more inclusive and efficient for individuals with diverse backgrounds, needs, and abilities.
