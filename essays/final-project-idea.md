# Overview

# Mockup page ideas
*Roles:* There are at least two roles in this system: Users (UH students) and Administrators (Faculty or Staff). Administrators are special users who have the ability to monitor the behavior of users in the system, and create new categories.

*Categories:* Breaks down categories by making it clear what kinds of items are listed in each category. For example: tech items, bags, apparel, accessories, books & stationery. Allows users to filter by item condition, recent finds, or date lost/found.

- Email notifications to alert users when a new item high-priority items (wallets, phones, etc.) are added
